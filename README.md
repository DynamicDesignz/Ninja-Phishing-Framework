# Ninja-Phishing-Framework


This is supposed to be a phishing framework to help penetration tester launch phishing attack against common web services.

The web application was written couple of years ago, and it is badly written. Lots of bugs, no input sanitization, no nothing.

It is not finished though, I got bored and I left it.
