# Ninja-Phishing-Framework


This is supposed to be a phishing framework to help penetration tester launch phishing attack against common web services.

The web application was written couple of years ago, and it is badly written. Lots of bugs, no input sanitization, no nothing.

It is not finished though, I got bored and I left it.

THINGS TO CHANGE OR ADD:
  * Input sanitization before inserting to the mysql database to prevent sql injections, xss and all of the other nasty stuff.
  * Saperate front-end templates from php. Kinda MVC style.
  * Adding a better code editor.
  * changing the old mysql functions with PDO.
  * Source code shouldn't have problems with php7 or the lastest stable php version.
  * Converting the source code to OOP.

and many other issues.
